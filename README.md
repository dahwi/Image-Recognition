## Goal of the Project
Begin to use machine learning, in form of pattern recognition, to teach our program what text looks like

<li> numpy </li>
<li> matplotlib </li>
<li> PIL or pillow </li>
</ul>

<li> Images to test our program </li>

<ul>

</ul>

</ul>

## Problem faced
Using defauly python installed in Linux CentOS 7, you need to install <strong> subprocess32</strong> and <strong> tkinter</strong> manually using
`pip install tkinter && pip install subprocess32`

Then you need to run
`echo "backend: qt4agg" > ~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc
`
